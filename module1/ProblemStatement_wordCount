Introduction:

Apply your MapReduce programming knowledge and write a MapReduce program to process a text file. You need to print the count of number of occurrences of each word in the text file. 

Let’s understand the problem through a sample text file content: 

“Hello everyone this is a sample dataset. You need to print the word count of particular words in this dataset.” 

Your MapReduce program should process this text file and should provide output as follows: 

Output 
  
Word 	Word Count   
a  		  1  				(As the word ‘a’ occurred only once) 
this 	  2 				(As the word ‘this’ occurred twice)  

bla bla bla........
